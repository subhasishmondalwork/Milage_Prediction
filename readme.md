# Mileage Prediction - Regression Analysis

## Project Overview

This repository contains a Python script that uses regression analysis to predict fuel efficiency (mpg) based on various vehicle attributes. The script utilizes the MPG dataset from the StatLib library and employs techniques such as data preprocessing, feature scaling, and model evaluation.

## Features

- Data Preprocessing: Handling missing values and selecting relevant features
- Feature Scaling: Standardizing continuous attributes for modeling
- Model Evaluation: Assessing the performance of a Linear Regression model using metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and R-squared (R2)

## Requirements

* Python 3.x
* pandas
* numpy
* matplotlib
* seaborn
* scikit-learn

## Usage

To run the script, execute `python Project_Outline.ipynb` in your terminal/command prompt.

## Contributions

Feel free to contribute by adding new features, improving existing code, or providing alternative solutions for better fuel efficiency prediction.
